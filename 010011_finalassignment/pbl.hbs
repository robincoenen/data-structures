<body>
<p>This page is understood as an annotated bibliography for my upcoming thesis. 
I am interested how Knowledge is shaped, formed, designed, archived, provided, searched and used. From Wikipedia: Knowledge is usually understood to be a set of facts, theories and rules available to persons or groups, which are characterized by the highest possible degree of certainty, so that their validity or truth is assumed. Knowledge or its storage is considered a cultural asset.</p>
